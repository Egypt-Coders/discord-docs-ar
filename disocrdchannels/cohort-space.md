# 🎓 Cohort Channels

The cohort channels are a group of channels that are only accessible by members of a specific cohort. These channels provide a space for cohort members to connect with each other, collaborate on projects, and receive support from their peers.

Within your cohort channels, you'll find a chat channel where you can communicate with other members of your cohort, as well as a voice chat for more interactive discussions. Additionally, each cohort has a README channel where moderators post important announcements and updates specific to your cohort.

Make sure to use these channels for their intended purpose, and respect the community guidelines and rules. If you have any questions about using cohort channels, don't hesitate to ask for help in the chat channels.
