# 🤖 Header Channels 

The header channels are channels that members cannot type in. Instead, they are used by moderators to pin important messages and send announcements to the rest of the community. These channels are a great way to keep everyone informed about upcoming events, changes to the program, and other important information. Make sure to check these channels regularly to stay up-to-date on everything happening in the ALX Egypt community.

### Those are the header channels and heres how to use them!
