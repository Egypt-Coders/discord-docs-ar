# üé§ The Stage Channel
The Stage Channel is similar to the Clubhouse app, providing a platform for live sessions and podcasts where community members can share ideas and engage in discussions in real-time.

### ‚úã Using the Hand Raise

The "Rise Hand" feature in Discord Stage allows users to indicate that they want to speak next. This is especially useful in larger conversations or when you have a question that's hard to explain. Sometimes the host may ask for a vote, in which case you should keep your hand raised until the host lowers it.

To raise your hand, simply click on the hand icon at the bottom of the screen.

### üñ• Watching the Mentor's Screen
Screensharing is a feature that allows users to share their computer screen with everyone in the Discord Stage. This is a great way to give presentations, show off your work, or collaborate with others in real-time. Whenever a mentor shares their screen, it will appear on top of the Stage Channel.
