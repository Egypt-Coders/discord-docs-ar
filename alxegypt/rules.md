# ðŸ“œ Rules.
**At ALX Egypt, we take community guidelines and rules very seriously. **

They are in place to ensure that our Discord server remains a safe and welcoming space for everyone.

However, these rules are also easy to follow and are designed to create a positive and supportive environment for all members. 

By following these rules, you can help create a community that fosters learning, collaboration, and social interaction among its members. 

If you have any questions about the rules or are unsure about how to follow them, don't hesitate to reach out to the server moderators for help.
